# Multi-tier App using Terraform and AWS
  This project demonstrates how to deploy a scalable, multi-tier web application infrastructure on AWS using Terraform as the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. It provides a modular and reusable Terraform configuration to provision the entire stack, including networking, compute, and security resources.

# Features
  Multi-tier architecture: Separates the application into distinct layers, such as web (frontend), application (backend), and database tiers.

# AWS infrastructure provisioning:

  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets

  Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway for secure internet access

  Security Groups with fine-grained rules for each tier

  Auto-scaling groups or EC2 instances for different tiers

  Load Balancers to distribute traffic

  RDS (optional) or database instances for persistent storage

# Terraform modular design: 
  Infrastructure components are organized as reusable modules for easy maintenance and extension.

# Automated provisioning:
  Everything is created and managed using Terraform, enabling easy replication and version control.

# Basic application deployment: 
  Optionally includes scripts or Terraform provisions to install and configure application software on instances (e.g., web servers, application servers).

# Security best practices: Proper segregation of public/private resources, secure access via SSH and security groups.

# Getting Started
  Install Terraform and configure your AWS CLI credentials.

# Clone this repository.

Review and customize the variables.tf or input variables for your specific environment.

Run terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply to deploy the infrastructure.

Access your deployed application through the provided load balancer DNS or public IP.

# Use Case
This repository is ideal for learning or bootstrapping infrastructure for multi-tier web applications on AWS with Terraform, whether for development, testing, or production environments.
